Texture packer for Unity. Open from *Window->Texture Packer*.

Choose one texture for each of the RGBA channels, and which source channel
that should be used for each texture.

All textures should be the same size, and must be marked as readable in
its import settings.

Click *Create* to save the resulting texture.
